\section{Baseline model}

\begin{exercise}
For the panel \texttt{Grunfeld} consider a regression
\begin{center}
	inv on value \& capital
\end{center}
\textbf{Remark}: here \texttt{firm} is an individual index, 
\texttt{year} is a time index.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item write down the specification of a baseline model
	\item import the dataset and set a MultiIndex over a pandas DataFrame 
	(please, mind  individual and time indices).
	\item Is the panel balanced or not?
	\item Evaluate matrices of regression design \(\vecty, \matrixX\)
	\item Fit the model using Pooling, RE, FE (within) and FD estimators
	\begin{itemize}
		\item via matrices of regression design
		\item via regression specification
	\end{itemize}
	and report the fitting result.
	\item For each model test the significance of coefficients. Perform both
	non-robust and robust test.
